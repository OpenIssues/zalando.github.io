At Zalando, we have many teams working on their respective systems and domains where they operate like small startups. They take responsibility for these systems and have a feeling of ownership, constantly engaging with other teams to solve bigger challenges and enable new features.

Sometimes during these alignments and feature requests, priorities collide and we can’t support others. In these situations, we aim for an InnerSource approach to address the required changes. This means that much like open source projects, the requesting team must implement the necessary changes in other components and the owner of these components has to review and approve the changes. This way, the impact on the owning team is minimal and the requesting team is not blocked.

Team Sokoban in Dortmund is responsible for Inventory Management at Zalando and we’ve had the opportunity to do a lot of InnerSourcing over the last months. We wanted to share some of our experiences and best practices, which can mostly be applied to usual open source InnerSourcing methods or sometimes even to day-to-day development.
