  Summary

<p class="dc-p strategy__subtitle">
Open Source has been part of the Zalando journey since the very beginning 10 years ago. Open source has served us well, and ensured that our engineering teams have had great tools and frameworks to their disposal to build and scale the systems supporting the business. 
<br>
Because of this legacy, we believe it is important that we contribute back to the open source community with projects that can benefit others, 
helping others to move forward,benefit from our experiences and investment benefits us all - as the old saying goes, a rising tide lifts all boats.

      <h4 class="dc-h4 insight__title">Code of Conduct is now mandatory</h4>

      <p class="dc-p">
        In November we introduced the use of Code of conduct files on all new projects being released
        and are working on introducing this across all public projects. We believe it is an important
        first step towards a friendlier and more diverse open source community.
