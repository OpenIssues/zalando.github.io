_This is the process for how Zalando employees release a new open source project on the [Zalando-Incubator](github.md). The process is simple and the open source team is ready to help you every step of the way._

When you've gone through the points below, open a review request to the open source review team.

## Overview

Releasing a new open source project is a simple and fast process if you are already following Zalandos rules of play:

* [Compliance](#Compliance) You ensure your project is compliant with rules of play and can be open sourced
* [Preparing your repository](#Preparing-your-repository) Clean up and refactor your code to work outside the Zalando environment.
* [Review](#Review) The Zalando open source review group is responsible for reviewing your

### What cannot be open sourced?

Anything that risks Zalandoâ€™s competitive advantage is not permissible for publication on GitHub.com. This typically means technologies we build that are intrinsic to generating or reinforcing the uniqueness of our customer experience. This could include (but is not limited to):

* confidential source code
* recommendation algorithms
* search functionalities that give us an edge over competitors

If you are in doubt, reach out to the Zalando Open Source Team.

## Compliance

Compliance covers the area of ensuring that we follow a safe and consistent practice for sharing and collaborating.

### Rules of play

All open source projects must comply with Zalandos [Rules Of Play](https://rulesofplay.docs.zalando.net/)(internal link), as well as the open source specific rules of play, which applies to code that any Zalando employee releases. There are 2 areas which the rules cover:

* Including the right files for licensing, documentation and ownership of the project
* Following the right procedure for how you create and release code
* Respecting and assigning copyright

#### Include the required assets

Use [new-project](https://github.com/perploug/new-project)(TODO: move to zalando org) as a boilerplate for the files required for your project. These files are needed to correctly communicate ownership and guidelines for the project.

1.  Create a meaningful `README.md` file, this is your most important piece of documentation
2.  Include a `MAINTAINERS.md` file with contact information
3.  Include a `CONTRIBUTION.md` file with guidelines on how to contribute
4.  Include a `SECURITY.md` file
5.  Add a `LICENSE.md` file, license must be the MIT license with the copyright set to Zalando SE
6.  Ensure you only use license-compatible code/dependencies (see [licensing](../using/licensing.md)

#### Use proper procedure for collaboration

1.  Semantically version project artifacts. You MUST tag all versions in GitHub with the exact version name: e.g., 0.1.0.
2.  Sign every commit, as per the [CDO](https://developercertificate.org/) - PGP signing is not required
3.  Ensure that no credentials, private identifiers or personal data is at any time present in your repository
4.  Enforce code-reviews with at least 2 sets of Zalando eyes on all code to minimize the risk of implanted security backdoors and vulnerable code.

### Community best practices

Besides the rules of play, there is also a set of best practices which we highly recommend you implement.

1.  Have a code of conduct and enforce it to create a safe environment for collaboration
2.  Have a clear vision and scope of your project
3.  Set clear expectations for responses - let users know if your time is limited
4.  Ask for help and be open to what kind of contributions would help your project
5.  Be mindful of your documentation

[opensource.guide](https://opensource.guide/building-community/) has plenty more resources and recommendations for maintainers.

### Copyright and ownership

Default ownership of all code released by Zalando employees are copyright Zalando SE and must be released under the Zalando GitHub organizations.  
Due to standards of European copyright law, any work by employees are the property of the employer. However, there can be made exceptions to this for unrelated projects, made out-of-hours and on a private laptop.
It is a legal grey area, so get in touch with the open source team for guidance, before releasing any private code.

## Preparing your repository

Preparing a repository for open sourcing goes beyond ensuring it is in compliance with the rules above. This can include refactoring and documenting your code better to ensure that users and potential contributors can make sense of it.

* Ensure you do not have any tokens, passwords or confidential data in your code
* Ensure the code doesn't require any Zalando-specific infrastructure or access, so users can use in their own environment
* Ensure your code is clear and commented so newcomers can see what is going on
* Ensure your dependencies are updated and does not have any known security issues

## Review

When you have checked off the compliance checklist and prepared your code for release, request a review from the Open Source Review Group who will help you setup a Github repository and sign off on open sourcing your code.

## Release

When all the above points are in order and the review has been passed, the project is released
on Zalando-Incubator. All new projects are released here and are then reviewed over a 6 month period for inclusion in the main Zalando org.
