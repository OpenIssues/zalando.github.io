The open source comminity is no different than any other online community, there is a risk of encountering negative or even abusive behavior from its members when you work as an open source contributor or maintainer. 

### Statistics on harassment in open source
An extensive [survey by Github](https://opensourcesurvey.org/2017/) in 2017 showed that nearly one of out five have experienced such negative behavior personally and 50% have witnessed it between other people - fortunately outright harassment is much less likely with 14% witnessing it and 3% experiencing it personally. 

Witnissing and experiencing behavior such as this can have a big negative impact on peoples desire to be part of open source communities, especially for groups such as women or ethnic or sexual minorities who are already underrepresented in the open source world (3% female, 16% ethnic minority, 7% sexual minority).

So overall, the open source community see an underrepresentation of minorities and those who do participate have a risk of encountering hostile behavior. Is the risk of harassment big? No - generally speaking the risk is low, but the impact of potential harrasment is very real. 

### Supporting employee participation
As an employer, Zalando encourages its employees to take active part in open source developement. Developers are granted time to maintain projects we release and to contribute upstream to projects which are of strategic importance to Zalando. We as a company therefore have an obligation to ensure that we support employees who engage in open source on Zalandos behalf.
