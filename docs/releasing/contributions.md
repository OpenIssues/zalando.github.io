# Accepting contributions

After your project is released you may wish to accept contributions from fellow Zalandos or the
wider open source community. This is highly encouraged and each individual project
team decides on which contributions go into their project.

## Rules of play that apply to contributions

New contributions must be submitted in the form of a pull-request which can then be reviewed by the project maintainers. As a project maintainer you must ensure the following standards are applied:

1.  Sign every commit, as per the [CDO](https://developercertificate.org/) - PGP signing is not required
2.  Ensure that no credentials, private identifiers or personal data is at any time present in your repository
3.  Enforce code-reviews with at least 2 sets of Zalando eyes on all code to minimize the risk of implanted security backdoors and vulnerable code.

## Have a clear workflow

To encourage contributions, you must provide a clear guide for how contributions gets accepted into the codebase. This must all be outlined in the CONTRIBUTION.md file.

* Document how to get the source code to build
* Document the PR review process
* Have a clear vision and scope for your project
* Be responsive to issues and pull requests, even if it's to decline them
